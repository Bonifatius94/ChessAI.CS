# LICENCE

I'll leave this endless lawyer shit out and tell you right away how I want this project to be used:

- This software is free for everyone, even companies. But you should at least mention me in the About dialog (or something like that) when you are using this code.
- You can fork, edit, distribute, ship as you like, but you may not make any monetary profit with it.
- There is NO (!!!) warranty. Why would you think there was one?! (I've put quite some unit testing effort into this, but everyone makes misstakes, right?)
