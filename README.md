# Abstract

This project offers a cross-plattform chess library for C# .NET Core, implementing all the basic functionality and also a bit of AI for 'best' draws computation. Moreover the project also contains a RESTful Web API for hosting a chess game server and a small website for interactive matchmaking is also planned.

# How To Build

For building the source code you just need to have Visual Studio 2017 with cross-plattform .NET Core tools installed (Community Edition should be enough). For building open the solution, wait until it finished loading and hit the build button.

# Roadmap

- improve the scoring system for the game situations
- improve AI performance and increase search depth
- test if the AI really selects the 'best' draw
- build a little database with 'good' chess draws
